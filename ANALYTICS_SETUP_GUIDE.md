# Analytics Setup Guide

## Problem Identified

Your analytics data was resetting every 30 minutes because the system was using **in-memory storage** as a fallback when Vercel KV (Redis) was not configured. In-memory storage on serverless functions resets whenever the function "cold-starts" (typically every 15-30 minutes of inactivity).

## Solution Implemented

I've enhanced your analytics system with:
1. **Persistent Storage** using Vercel KV (Redis)
2. **Session Tracking** to understand user behavior
3. **Enhanced Metrics** including unique sessions and conversion rates
4. **Improved Dashboard** with 4 key metrics instead of 3

## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create Vercel KV Database

1. **Log in to Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
   - Select your project (`insta-tryon-2-1`)

2. **Create a KV Database**
   - Click on the **Storage** tab in your project
   - Click **Create Database**
   - Select **KV (Key-Value Store)**
   - Name it: `analytics-kv` (or any name you prefer)
   - Select a region close to your users (e.g., `us-east-1`)
   - Click **Create**

3. **Connect to Your Project**
   - After creation, click **Connect to Project**
   - Select your `insta-tryon-2-1` project
   - Click **Connect**
   - Vercel will automatically add these environment variables:
     - `KV_REST_API_URL`
     - `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`
     - `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`
     - `KV_URL`

### Step 2: Install Vercel KV Package

Run this command in your project directory:

```bash
npm install @vercel/kv
```

### Step 3: Deploy Your Changes

After I've made the code changes, deploy to Vercel:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add persistent analytics with Vercel KV"
git push
```

Vercel will automatically deploy your changes.

### Step 4: Verify Setup

1. **Test Try-On Feature**
   - Go to your live site
   - Try on a few outfits
   - Wait for successful try-on completions

2. **Check Analytics Dashboard**
   - Log in to Admin page (your password: `GoSienna2024!`)
   - Click the **Analytics** button
   - You should see:
     - Total Try-Ons counter
     - Unique Sessions counter
     - Unique Outfits counter
     - Average Try-ons per Session
     - Last 7 Days Activity chart
     - Most Popular Outfits ranking
     - Recent Activity feed

3. **Test Persistence**
   - Note the current analytics numbers
   - Wait 30-60 minutes
   - Refresh the analytics dashboard
   - **The numbers should persist** (not reset to zero)

## What's Been Enhanced

### New Metrics Tracked

1. **Session ID** - Unique identifier for each user session (30-minute window)
2. **User Agent** - Browser/device information
3. **Referrer** - Where users came from
4. **Unique Sessions** - Count of distinct user sessions
5. **Conversion Rate** - Average try-ons per session

### Updated Dashboard

The analytics dashboard now shows:

- **Total Try-Ons** - All-time count of virtual try-ons
- **Unique Sessions** - Number of distinct user sessions
- **Unique Outfits** - Different outfits that have been tried
- **Avg Per Session** - Average try-ons per user session
- **Last 7 Days Chart** - Visual activity graph
- **Most Popular Outfits** - Top 10 outfits with percentages
- **Recent Activity** - Last 20 try-on events with timestamps

### Data Storage

- **Primary**: Vercel KV (Redis) - Persistent, survives restarts
- **Fallback**: In-memory - Only used if KV is not configured
- **Capacity**: Stores up to 10,000 most recent events
- **Retention**: Unlimited time (until manually cleared or storage limit reached)

## Troubleshooting

### Analytics Not Saving

**Issue**: Data still resets after 30 minutes

**Solution**:
1. Check Vercel Dashboard > Storage > KV database exists
2. Verify environment variables are set in Vercel project settings
3. Check build logs for errors: `KV not available, using in-memory storage`
4. Ensure `@vercel/kv` package is installed in `package.json`

### No Data Showing

**Issue**: Dashboard shows zero try-ons

**Solution**:
1. Complete at least one virtual try-on successfully
2. Check browser console for API errors (F12 > Console)
3. Verify `/api/analytics` endpoint is responding:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-domain.com/api/analytics
   ```

### KV Connection Errors

**Issue**: Console shows "Failed to connect to KV"

**Solution**:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard > Your Project > Settings > Environment Variables
2. Verify these variables exist:
   - `KV_REST_API_URL`
   - `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`
   - `KV_URL`
3. If missing, reconnect the KV database to your project
4. Redeploy the application
