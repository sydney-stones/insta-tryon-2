## 💼 Revenue Features (Perfect for Pitch)

### Feature 1: Increase Average Order Value (AOV)
**"Boosts AOV" badge** prominently displayed

**The Pitch:**
> "When customers try on this jumper, they see the complete styled look. Instead of buying one £895 item, they're inspired to purchase the full outfit worth £4,324. That's a **383% increase in cart value**."

### Feature 2: Affiliate Revenue from Partner Brands
**Green commission badge** on Ralph Lauren shoes

**The Pitch:**
> "When ERDEM features partner brand items in their styled looks, they earn affiliate commission on every sale. In this example, they earn **£12 from Ralph Lauren shoes** - creating a new revenue stream without holding inventory."

### Feature 3: Cross-Brand Monetization
**Revenue insight box** explains the model

**The Pitch:**
> "Partner items are clearly marked with commission badges. ERDEM customers can complete their look with complementary pieces, and ERDEM earns passive income from these partnerships. It's a win-win-win: customers get styled looks, partners get sales, ERDEM gets commission."
