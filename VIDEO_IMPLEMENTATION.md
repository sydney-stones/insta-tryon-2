# Video Implementation Summary

## ✅ Changes Made

I've successfully added video support to all 5 fashion brand product pages!

---

## 📝 Files Modified

### 1. [types.ts](types.ts:17)
**Added:** `videoUrl?: string;` to the WardrobeItem interface

This allows each outfit to have an optional video URL alongside images.

### 2. [wardrobe.ts](wardrobe.ts)
**Added video URLs to all 5 fashion brands:**

| Brand | Video File | Line |
|-------|-----------|------|
| Emilia Wickstead | emiliawickstead.mp4 | 546 |
| Uniqlo | uniqlo.mp4 | 580 |
| Really Wild | reallywild.mp4 | 624 |
| ERDEM | erdem.mp4 | 663 |
| Manolo Blahnik | bhalnik.mp4 | 702 |

## 📹 Video Files Added

All videos are in the `Renderings/` folder:

```
Renderings/
├── bhalnik.mp4         (3.0 MB)
├── emiliawickstead.mp4 (2.7 MB)
├── erdem.mp4           (7.8 MB)
├── reallywild.mp4      (4.4 MB)
└── uniqlo.mp4          (4.3 MB)
```

Total video size: ~22 MB

## 🎬 How It Works

Each product now has 3 media options:

1. **Primary Image (`url`)** - Flat lay of the outfit
2. **Secondary Image (`secondaryImageUrl`)** - Virtual try-on rendering
3. **Video (`videoUrl`)** - Video showcase of the outfit ✨ NEW!

Your frontend code can now access the video URL via:
```typescript
outfit.videoUrl // Returns the video URL
```

## 🚀 Next Steps - Deploy Videos

### Step 1: Commit and Push Videos to GitHub

```bash
# Add video files
git add Renderings/*.mp4

# Add code changes
git add types.ts wardrobe.ts

# Commit
git commit -m "Add video support and videos for all fashion brand product pages"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Verify Videos on GitHub

1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to `Renderings/` folder
3. Verify all 5 MP4 files are uploaded

### Step 3: Test Video URLs

After pushing, your videos will be accessible at:
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sydney-stones/insta-tryon-2/main/Renderings/emiliawickstead.mp4`
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sydney-stones/insta-tryon-2/main/Renderings/uniqlo.mp4`
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sydney-stones/insta-tryon-2/main/Renderings/reallywild.mp4`
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sydney-stones/insta-tryon-2/main/Renderings/erdem.mp4`
- `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sydney-stones/insta-tryon-2/main/Renderings/bhalnik.mp4`

## 💡 Frontend Implementation Notes

To display videos in your product pages, you can use standard HTML5 video:

```tsx
{outfit.videoUrl && (
  <video
    src={outfit.videoUrl}
    controls
    autoPlay
    muted
    loop
    className="w-full h-auto"
  >
    Your browser does not support video playback.
  </video>
)}
```

Or use the video as a third option in your image carousel/gallery.

## 📊 Video Optimization (Optional)

For better performance, consider:

1. **Compress videos** if loading is slow
   - Use https://www.freeconvert.com/video-compressor
   - Target: 2-3 MB per video

2. **Lazy loading**
   - Only load video when user clicks/hovers
   - Improves initial page load time

3. **Video hosting** (if GitHub becomes slow)
   - Vercel Blob Storage
   - Cloudinary
   - AWS S3 + CloudFront

For now, GitHub hosting works perfectly fine for your use case!
