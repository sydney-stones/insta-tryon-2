# Video Display Implementation - Complete!

## ✅ Videos Now Display on Product Pages

I've updated the product detail page to display videos with autoplay and loop functionality!

---

## 🎬 What Changed

### Updated: [components/ProductDetailPage.tsx](components/ProductDetailPage.tsx)

**Key Changes:**

1. **Changed `productImages` to `productMedia`** (line 23-40)
   - Now tracks both images AND videos
   - Each media item has a `type` property: 'image' or 'video'

2. **Added Video Display in Main View** (line 76-91)
   - Checks if current media is a video
   - If video: Shows `<video>` element with autoplay, loop, muted
   - If image: Shows regular `<img>` element

3. **Updated Thumbnail Gallery** (line 109-149)
   - Video thumbnails show a play icon overlay
   - Clicking video thumbnail displays the full video
   - Videos in thumbnails don't autoplay (better UX)

---

## 🎥 Video Features

### Main Video Display:
- ✅ **AutoPlay** - Videos start playing automatically
- ✅ **Loop** - Videos repeat continuously
- ✅ **Muted** - Sound is off by default (required for autoplay)
- ✅ **PlaysInline** - Works on mobile devices
- ✅ **Object-cover** - Video fits the container perfectly

### Thumbnail Display:
- ✅ **Play Icon** - Shows ▶️ icon on video thumbnails
- ✅ **Muted Preview** - Thumbnail videos don't play (better performance)
- ✅ **Click to Play** - Clicking thumbnail shows full video

## 📱 Media Order on Product Pages

For each fashion brand, media displays in this order:

1. **Primary Image** - Flat lay outfit photo
2. **Secondary Image** - Virtual try-on rendering
3. **Video** - Autoplaying video showcase ✨ NEW!
4. **Your Model** - Saved model photo (if exists)

Example for Emilia Wickstead:
1. EmiliaWickstead.png (flat lay)
2. EmiliaWickstead.png (rendering)
3. emiliawickstead.mp4 (video) ← **Autoplays & loops**
4. Your saved model (if you've generated one)

## 🎯 User Experience

## 💡 Technical Details

### Video Element Properties:
```tsx
<video
  src={videoUrl}
  autoPlay      // Starts playing immediately
  loop          // Repeats forever
  muted         // Sound off (required for autoplay)
  playsInline   // Mobile compatibility
  className="h-full w-full object-cover"  // Full container fit
/>
```

### Why `muted`?
Browsers require videos to be muted for autoplay to work. This is a security/UX feature to prevent unexpected audio.

### Why `playsInline`?
On iOS Safari, without this attribute, videos open in fullscreen. This keeps them inline on the page.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Videos don't autoplay?
- Make sure videos are uploaded to GitHub
- Check browser console for errors
- Some browsers block autoplay - `muted` should fix this

### Videos look pixelated?
- Videos are compressed (2-8 MB each)
- This is normal for web delivery
- If needed, re-compress at higher quality

### Videos don't load?
- Check the video URLs are correct
- Verify videos are pushed to GitHub
- Check GitHub raw URLs are accessible
