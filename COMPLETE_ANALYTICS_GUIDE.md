## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Custom Analytics Issues

**No data in dashboard:**
- Complete at least 1 try-on
- Check Vercel logs for Redis connection
- Verify `REDIS_URL` environment variable
- Check browser console for errors

**Data not in Redis Insight:**
- Refresh Redis Insight (F5)
- Check database is selected
- Verify key name: `analytics:events`
- Test API: `curl https://your-site.com/api/analytics`

**Sessions not tracking:**
- Clear browser localStorage
- Try in incognito mode
- Check 30-minute session timeout

### Vercel Analytics Issues

**No page views showing:**
- Wait 30-60 seconds after visiting
- Disable ad blockers/privacy tools
- Navigate between multiple pages
- Check Analytics is enabled in Vercel Dashboard

**Incorrect page counts:**
- Vercel Analytics deduplicates within 30 seconds
- Single-page apps track route changes automatically
- Check network tab for `/_vercel/insights/view` calls

**Missing geographic data:**
- Vercel uses IP geolocation
- VPNs may affect country detection
- Some privacy browsers block geolocation

## üìä Reporting & Exporting

### Custom Analytics Export (Future)

Want to export try-on data to CSV/Excel? I can add:

```javascript

downloadCSV('analytics-export.csv');

// Export date range
downloadCSV('october-analytics.csv', {
  start: '2025-10-01',
  end: '2025-10-31'
